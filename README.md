## Packages used
##### vue-i18n

## Additional items
##### I also recommends you use BabelEdit to manage translations (Available for Mac & Windows)
##### https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit  (Has a trial, and the paid option to get more automatic Google translation queries is incredibly reasonable)
